# OMR Processing Flow Test

## ✅ **Fixed Issues:**

### **1. Cleared Dummy Data**
- ✅ Removed sample results from App.tsx
- ✅ Updated ResultsPage to show real data
- ✅ Fixed hardcoded statistics

### **2. Fixed Processing Flow**
- ✅ Upload shows "Upload started" immediately
- ✅ Processing status updates in real-time
- ✅ Results appear after processing completes
- ✅ Automatic switch to Results tab
- ✅ Success message with score

### **3. Updated Data Structure**
- ✅ Fixed property names (scores vs per_subject_scores)
- ✅ Added confidence score display
- ✅ Added evaluation mode display
- ✅ Added processing timestamp

## 🧪 **Test the Complete Flow:**

### **Step 1: Open the App**
- Go to: `http://localhost:8088/`
- You should see empty results dashboard (no dummy data)

### **Step 2: Upload an Image**
- Go to "Upload" tab
- Select evaluation mode (Easy/Moderate/Strict)
- Upload any image file
- You should see:
  - "Upload started" toast
  - Processing status in uploads list
  - Progress updates

### **Step 3: Processing**
- Watch the processing status update
- Should complete in ~1 second
- You should see:
  - "Processing completed" toast with score
  - Automatic switch to Results tab
  - New result appears in dashboard

### **Step 4: View Results**
- Results tab should show:
  - Real statistics (not hardcoded)
  - Your processed result
  - Subject-wise scores
  - Confidence percentage
  - Evaluation mode
  - Processing timestamp

## 🔍 **Expected Behavior:**

1. **Empty Start**: No dummy data, clean dashboard
2. **Upload**: Immediate feedback, processing status
3. **Processing**: Real-time progress updates
4. **Results**: Automatic display with real data
5. **Statistics**: Dynamic calculations based on actual results

## 🐛 **If Issues Occur:**

1. **Check Browser Console**: F12 → Console for errors
2. **Check Network Tab**: Look for failed requests
3. **Verify Backend**: Check if backend API is available
4. **Check Logs**: Look for processing errors

The flow should now work perfectly from upload to results! 🎉
